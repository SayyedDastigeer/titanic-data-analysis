# Titanic Data Analysis (EDA Project)

This project performs an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the famous **Titanic dataset** to understand passenger demographics, survival rates, and uncover hidden patterns using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

##  Objective

The goal is to:
- Clean and preprocess the Titanic dataset
- Explore distributions and relationships between features
- Visualize survival trends based on gender, age, class, etc.
- Gain insights that can be used for predictive modeling

## Dataset

- Source: [Kaggle - Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data)
- Files Used:
  - `train.csv`

---

##  Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

##  EDA Steps Covered

1. **Data Loading & Overview**
   - Dataset dimensions, column types, missing values

2. **Data Cleaning**
   - Handling missing values (e.g., Age, Embarked)
   - Converting data types
   - Dropping irrelevant columns

3. **Univariate Analysis**
   - Distribution of age, fare, class, sex, embarked
   - Survival rate by category

4. **Bivariate Analysis**
   - Survival by gender
   - Survival by class
   - Age vs Fare scatter plot
   - Heatmap of correlations

5. **Insights**
   - Key observations and questions raised by the data

## 📌 Key Findings

- Female passengers had a much higher survival rate than males
- First class passengers had higher chances of survival
- Most passengers were in the 20–40 age group
- Missing age values could impact modeling if not handled
